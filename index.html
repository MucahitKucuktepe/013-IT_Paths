                <h2>Data data_science</h2>
                <p>Definition of the topic not universal, and there is no such agreement between companies; instead, the
                    same title may require a different skill-set. But we can state that Data Scientists are
                    new-generation
                    data analysts who have good computer skills, programming, statistics, and mathematical skills and a
                    great sense of unearthing valuable data lying under the data ocean.
                    According to Harvard Business Review, data scientist is “The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century” in
                    October-2012. Of course, we can’t cover every potential data science job title that a company might
                    use
                    in this article. Still, we can talk about some of the significant roles like data analyst, data
                    scientist, and data engineering in the data science universe, how they differ, and the progression
                    in
                    the field if you’re starting in that role.
